# Go-Concepts
Playing with concepts of programming I've found interesting using Golang. E.g. machine learning, genetic algorithms, graph theory, etc.

Here we have a small collection of snippets I've written in Golang in order to implement data structures and algorithms
found in various text books on algorithms and datastructures.

The prettiest this in this repo is probably the demo of [Genetic Algorithm implementation here](Play/003-GA-WebGL)
